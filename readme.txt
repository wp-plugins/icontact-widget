== Description ==
__Simple iContact Installation on Your Blog__
Add the iContact 'Automatic Sign-up Form' to your sidebar with this widget. Simply paste the code from the form you created in iContact into this widget. Your form will be converted into HTML (instead of Javascript, which takes more time to load).

Change the width of your form, the submit button text, and more! (Check out the screenshot.)
