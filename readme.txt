== Description ==

<h3>Simple iContact Signup Form Installation on Your Blog</h3>

Add the iContact 'Automatic Sign-up Form' to your sidebar with this widget. Simply paste the code from the form you created in iContact into this widget. Your form will be converted into HTML (instead of Javascript, which takes more time to load).

### iContact Widget Configuration Options

* Change the width of your form
* Change the submit button text
* Choose which page to redirect users to upon successful completion
* Open the form in a new window

The plugin includes __shortcode support__ -- add an iContact form into your page or post!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the new `add_filters()` functionality? (Added 1.1) =
If you want to change some code in the widget, you can use the WordPress `add_filter()` function to achieve this.

You can add code to your theme's `functions.php` file that will modify the widget or shortcode output. Here's an example:
<pre>
function my_example_function($widget) {
	// The $widget variable is the output of the widget
	// This will replace 'this word' with 'that word' in the widget output.
	$widget = str_replace('this word', 'that word', $widget);
	// Make sure to return the $widget variable, or it won't work!
	return $widget;
}
add_filter('icontact_signup_form_code', 'my_example_function');
</pre>

= How do I remove the link to iContact? =
Add the following code to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`add_filter('icontact_link', create_function('$a', 'return false;'));`

= What is the plugin license? =
